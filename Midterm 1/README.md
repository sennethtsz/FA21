# CSE 6040/x: Practice Problems for Midterm 1 #

We are releasing a collection of practice problems for Midterm 1. Most of them were taken from previous exams. These materials, along with sample solutions, should be available via Canvas/Vocareum beginning later today (Saturday, May 29).

> _Note 0:_ If you post Piazza questions about these problems, please use the naming convention `pmt1.xx.yy` for Practice Midterm 1, Problem `xx`, Exercise `yy`, and tag your post with the `practice_mt1`. That will help you find relevant posts and will help us triage.

> _Note 1:_ Some of the TAs have volunteered to record video walkthroughs that explain how they approached these problems. We will update this post when those are ready. In the meantime, you can download sample solutions on Canvas.

One caveat is that the exam format has changed over time. For example:
* In Spring 2020, there were two problems worth ten points each, with a time-limit of three (3) hours per problem; however, to earn "full credit" (100%) a student only needed to get 16 points, not all 20 available points. (We announce the point threshold _before_ the exam begins. Earned points beyond that threshold do _not_ count as extra credit, but feel free to do it "for the glory.")
* In Fall 2020, there was just one problem worth 14 points, also with a time limit of three (3) hours. The 100%-threshold was 12 points.
* In Spring 2021, there was just one problem worth 11 points, with a time limit of 3.5 hours (210 minutes). The 100%-threshold was 10 points.

The Spring 2021 exam is Problem 24 in the collection; the Fall 2020 exam is Problem 23; and the Spring 2020 exam corresponds to both Problems 21 and 22. The Summer 2021 exam will mimic the Spring 2020, Fall 2020, and Spring 2021 exams in format and style. However, the exact time limit (between 3-4 hours) and the "100%-threshold" will depend on how hard we believe the problems are based on our internal staff testing. All other problems are there to help you assess your coverage of the material.

**All other logistical details about the Midterm 1 that you will take will be announced later, so please wait for those instead of asking lots of logistical questions now.**

## Suggested problems ##

In all, the practice problems collection includes 9 problems, which is a lot! So, to help you prioritize, here is what we think you should focus on.

_From Spring 2020, Fall 2020, and Spring 2021_: The Summer 2021 exam will most closely resemble this set of examples in format and style of test code. So at a minimum, try to do these.
- Problem 21 (Spring 2020 -- caption contest)
- Problem 22 (Spring 2020 -- ingredient substitutions)
- Problem 23 (Fall 2020 -- congressional vote analysis)
- Problem 24 (Spring 2021 -- music recommender)

_Earlier examples_: The following problems are from earlier years and are representative of the content you are expected to know. However, the expected time to solve these problems might differ from the above because the exam time limits were different. (Also, the style of test code was less robust.)
- Problem 20 (document clustering)
- Problem 2 (DNA sequences)
- Problem 7 (hambot) -- _Note:_ This problem also appeared as an exercise in the Prymer.
- Problem 9 (MLE/floating-point)
- Problem 14 (538/djt)

_Other demos_: These are not real exam problems but are worth a quick look:
- Problem 15 (hidden test cell demo) -- _Note:_ It is unlikely that we will use hidden tests. However, this notebook does have an interesting conceptual problem related to computational efficiency that is worth looking at.
- Problem 16 (debug-a-thon)
