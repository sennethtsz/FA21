# CSE 6040/x: Practice Problems for Midterm 2 #

_(The text below is from the [Spring 2021 announcement](https://piazza.com/class/khxuuzvsj6x3ij?cid=2239).)_

We are releasing a collection of practice problems for Midterm 2. Most of them were taken from previous exams, and include almost all problems ever given in this class. These should be available in edX (online students) or Canvas (on-campus students) starting today, Tuesday, March 16.

> If you post Piazza questions about these problems, please use the naming convention `pmt2.xx.yy` for Practice Midterm 2, Problem `xx`, Exercise `yy`, and tag your post with the `practice_mt2`. That will help you find relevant posts and will help your peers and us with triaging.

One caveat is that the exam format has changed over time. In Spring 2020, there were two problems worth 17 points total (11 points for one, 6 points for the other), with a total time of 4 hours to work on them; however, to earn "full credit" (100%) a student only needed to get 12 points. In Fall 2020, there was one problem worth 18 points with a 100% threshold of 15 points, with a time limit of 3 hours. (We announce the time limits and point threshold _before_ the exam begins. Earned points beyond that threshold do _not_ count as extra credit, but feel free to do it "for the glory.")

The Spring 2020 exam corresponds to Problems 18 and 19 in the collection, and the Fall 2020 exam corresponds to Problem 20. The Spring 2021 exam will mimic the 2020 exams in format and style. However, the exact time limit (between 3-4 hours) and the "100%-threshold" will depend on how hard we believe the problems are based on our internal testing. All other problems are there to help you assess your coverage of the material. Most other logistical details about Midterm 2 are identical to Midterm 1.

Twenty-one practice problems is a lot! So, to help you prioritize, here is what we think you should focus on.

## Suggested problems ##

From Spring and Fall 2020 -- The Spring 2021 problems will most closely resemble these in format and style of test code. So at a minimum, try them.
- Problem 18 (COVID-19, Spring 2020)
- Problem 19 (shortest paths, Spring 2020)
- Problem 20 (human migration, Fall 2020)

The following problems are from earlier years and are representative of the content you are expected to know. However, the expected time to solve these problems might differ from the above because the time limits were different. (Also, the style of test code was less robust.)
- Problem 2 (Conway's Game of Life using Numpy)
- Problem 9 (SQL)
- Problem 10 (Pandas + network analysis)
- Problem 11 (Numpy / n-body)
- Problem 12 (Major League Baseball / Numpy / pandas / efficiency test)
- Problem 13 (pandas)
- Problem 15 (neural networks / Numpy)
- Problem 17 (recommender system)

## Challenge problem ##

If you think you really know your stuff, try Problem 7 (a tensor computation). Most people find this one to be pretty hard.

## Additional problems ##

The remaining problems are interesting, but in terms of what they cover, they largely duplicate the content of the problems listed above. Therefore, you can probably skip them unless you feel you need even more practice.
